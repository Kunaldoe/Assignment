First session on github :-


What is git?

-> Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their 
   codebase,collaborate with others, and manage their software projects efficiently.

   GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides additional features for collaboration,
   code hosting, and project management. GitHub allows developers to host their Git repositories online, making it easier for 
   teams to work together on code.

What is Stashing ?

->Stashing is nothing but all the changes that i have made i dont want to commit it but also dont want to lose it,
  then this all data will be saved in another folder that is not visible but when we want that data we can get it.

Different commands :- exaples

		        cd          -> change directory
		        mkdir       -> make new directory
		        touch       -> to create new text file
		        rm -rf      -> to remove file
			git add     -> to add changes
			git commit -m -> to commit changes
			git remote add origin -> adding url of repository
			git push origin master -> to see commits and files in repository
