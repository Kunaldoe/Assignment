How to Squash Commits in Git
         To "squash" in Git means to combine multiple commits into one. You can do this at any point in time (by using Git's "Interactive Rebase" feature), though it is most 
often done when merging branches.
        Please note that there is no such thing as a stand-alone git squash command. Instead, squashing is rather an option when performing other Git commands like interactive
 rebase or merge.
         "squashing" your commits means that you combine multiple existing commits into a single one. If you should do this or avoid it is - to some extent - a question of preference: 
in some teams, for example, squashing commits is the preferred way to merge a feature branch back into a long-running branch like "master" or "main".
