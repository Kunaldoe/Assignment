What is stashing?
   Stashing your work
              The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy. 
For example: $ git status On branch main Changes to be committed: new file: style. css Changes not staged for commit: modified: index.
              git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them 
later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else,but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
