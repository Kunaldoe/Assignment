What is stashing?
         The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.
Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work.
 Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branches without committing the current branch.
